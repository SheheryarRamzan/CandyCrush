# CandyCrush
The project aims to develop a simplified version of the popular mobile game Candy Crush using assembly language x86. The game will be implemented for a console-based environment, providing users with an engaging and interactive gaming experience.

The key features of the Candy Crush game in assembly x86 will include:

Game Grid: The game will consist of a grid of cells, where candies can be placed. The grid will be displayed on the console window and updated as the game progresses.

Candy Types: Different types of candies will be represented by characters or symbols on the grid. Each candy type will have a unique appearance, making it visually appealing to the players.

Matching Candies: Players will be able to swap adjacent candies to create matches. When three or more candies of the same type align either horizontally or vertically, they will be removed from the grid, and new candies will fall from the top to fill the empty spaces.

Scoring System: The game will keep track of the player's score, which will increase as they make successful candy matches. The score will be displayed on the console window, providing feedback and motivation to the player.

User Input: Players will interact with the game using keyboard inputs. They will be able to navigate the cursor on the grid, select candies for swapping, and perform actions like quitting the game or restarting a level.

Game Over and Victory: The game will end if the player fails to reach the target score within the given number of moves. However, if the player successfully reaches the target score, they will advance to the next level.

Graphics and Animations: Although limited by the console-based environment, the game will strive to provide visual feedback through simple graphics and animations. This can include highlighting matched candies, displaying explosions or special effects, and updating the grid dynamically.

By implementing the Candy Crush game in assembly x86, the project aims to showcase the power and flexibility of low-level programming. It will challenge the developer to optimize code execution, manage memory efficiently, and create an enjoyable gaming experience within the limitations of the console environment.
